				<p>
					Hi there! My name is <span>Jerome Wy</span> and I am Full Stack
					Developer with a passion for design and coding. I have 11+ years of
					professional experience in Healthcare (Pharmacy) and have spent the
					last five in medical devices as a Project Manager. I've wanted to be a
					software engineer/web developer since I was 10 years old coding anime
					websites and in Nov 2021, I finally decided to go for it!
					<br />
					<br />
					If you want to chat about a collaboration or if you just want to chat
					in general, feel free to reach out to me!
