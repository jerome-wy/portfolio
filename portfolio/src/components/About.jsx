          Hi there! My name is Jerome and I am Full Stack Developer with a
          passion for design and coding. I have 11+ years of professional
          experience in Healthcare (Pharmacy) and have spent the last five in
          medical devices as a Project Manager. I've wanted to be a software
          engineer/web developer since I was 10 years old and in Nov 2021, I
          finally decided to go for it!
        </p>

        <p>
          Please do not hesitate to reach out to me! I'd love to chat and talk
          about how we can collaborate or if you want to talk code, design, or
          even gaming!
        </p>
