					about <span>jero</span>me
				</h1>
				<p>
					Hi there! My name is <span>Jerome Wy</span> and I am Full Stack
					Developer with a passion for design and coding. I have 11+ years of
					professional experience in Healthcare (Pharmacy) and have spent the
					last five in medical devices as a Project Manager. I've wanted to be a
					software engineer/web developer since I was 10 years old coding anime
					websites and in Nov 2021, I finally decided to go for it!
				</p>

				<p>
					On the front-end, I use HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, and Vue. I
					also love using React libraries - like react-burger-menu and
					react-animated-css I used in this portfolio. On the back-end side, I
					use Python, Django, MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, and PostgreSQL.
					Between you and me, I think front-end is much more fun.
				</p>

				<p>
					This portfolio is a much prettier and interactive resume. Let me know
					if you have any questions!
				</p>
